**Topic:** *Cubic Spline Interpolation vs Lagrange Interpolation*  
**Course:** CSE261: Numerical Methods  
**Institution:** Southeast University, Bangladesh

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project implements **Cubic Spline Interpolation** from scratch in Python and compares it with **Lagrange Interpolation** (using SciPy).  

We applied both methods on a dataset of **temperature variation over time** and visualized the results.  

The project is divided into modular parts so that each team member contributed separately.
